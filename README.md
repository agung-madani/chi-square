# Chi-Square Test for Feature Selection
The Chi-Square test is a statistical method used to determine the association between two categorical variables. In the context of feature selection, it helps identify which input features are most relevant to a specific target variable. This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates how to perform a Chi-Square test for feature selection using Python libraries like pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, sklearn, and scipy.
### Dependencies
Before running the code, ensure you have the following libraries installed:
* pandas
* seaborn
* matplotlib
* scikit-learn
* scipy
  
For this demonstration, we'll be using a dataset for loan prediction. You can access the dataset [here](https://github.com/aswintechguy/Data-Science-Concepts/blob/main/Machine%20Learning/data/Loan%20Prediction%20Dataset.csv).
